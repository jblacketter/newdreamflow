# Portal Hub Bridge - Deployment Notes for Render

## Overview
This document serves as a reference for deploying the Portal Hub Bridge repository to Render, based on our experience deploying the Dream Journal application.

## Key Considerations for Portal Hub Bridge

### 1. Repository Details
- Repository: [Add portal hub bridge repo URL]
- Tech Stack: [Add tech stack details]
- Database Requirements: [PostgreSQL/Other]
- External Services: [List any APIs, services]

### 2. Differences from Dream Journal
- [ ] Different framework/runtime?
- [ ] Different build process?
- [ ] Different environment variables?
- [ ] Different static file handling?
- [ ] WebSocket requirements?
- [ ] Background jobs/workers?

### 3. Render Configuration Checklist

#### render.yaml Template
```yaml
databases:
  - name: portalhub-db
    databaseName: portalhub
    user: portalhub
    plan: free

services:
  - type: web
    name: portalhub
    runtime: [python/node/other]
    plan: free
    buildCommand: "[build command]"
    startCommand: "[start command]"
    envVars:
      - key: DATABASE_URL
        fromDatabase:
          name: portalhub-db
          property: connectionString
      - key: SECRET_KEY
        generateValue: true
      # Add other env vars
```

#### Environment Variables Needed
- [ ] DATABASE_URL (auto-provided by Render)
- [ ] SECRET_KEY
- [ ] API Keys
- [ ] Service URLs
- [ ] Other configuration

### 4. Pre-Deployment Checklist
- [ ] Repository is accessible on GitHub
- [ ] All secrets removed from codebase
- [ ] Production dependencies listed
- [ ] Build scripts prepared
- [ ] Database migrations ready
- [ ] Static file handling configured

### 5. Common Issues from Dream Journal Deployment

1. **Database Configuration**
   - Don't manually set DATABASE_URL in Render
   - Ensure app can detect and use PostgreSQL
   - Have migration strategy ready

2. **Start Command**
   - Must be the actual server command
   - Not one-time setup commands

3. **ALLOWED_HOSTS**
   - Must include Render domain
   - Format: `your-app.onrender.com`

4. **Build Process**
   - Make build script executable
   - Include all setup steps
   - Handle failures gracefully

### 6. Deployment Steps Summary

1. Create Render account and connect GitHub
2. Create new Web Service
3. Configure build and start commands
4. Set environment variables
5. Deploy and monitor logs
6. Run post-deployment tasks in Shell
7. Test application thoroughly

### 7. Questions to Answer Before Deployment

1. **Runtime & Framework**
   - What language/framework?
   - Version requirements?
   - Special runtime needs?

2. **Database**
   - PostgreSQL compatible?
   - Migration strategy?
   - Seeding requirements?

3. **External Services**
   - What APIs are used?
   - Authentication methods?
   - Rate limits/quotas?

4. **File Storage**
   - User uploads?
   - Static assets?
   - CDN requirements?

5. **Performance**
   - Expected traffic?
   - Resource requirements?
   - Scaling needs?

### 8. Post-Deployment Tasks
- [ ] Run database migrations
- [ ] Create admin users
- [ ] Initialize search indices
- [ ] Configure external services
- [ ] Set up monitoring
- [ ] Test all features

### 9. Monitoring & Maintenance
- Check logs regularly
- Monitor performance
- Keep dependencies updated
- Regular backups
- Security patches
